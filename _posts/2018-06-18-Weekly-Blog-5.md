    <td>I learnt by doing what I do best and worst: reading. I will explain what I mean by that below. The most effective strategy that I mentioned at the end of my previous blog was to grab a great computer right at the start of the lesson. This strategy was not only effective but necessary as my usual computer had not been fixed yet. The possession of a good computer meant that I could get a solid amount of work done.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>For the first few exercises in a section I had to read the details and specific wording of the brief and for me that's actually surprisingly difficult to do.  For the middle exercises where I am just practicing skills explained in the first few exercises I can just skim read the brief and then get on wit the work which I am in fact pretty adept at. Besides this my main hindrance was the difficulty of the work itself. </td>

    <td>Next time there is very little that I can, at this point in time, think to change. I think I am learning at a pace that suits me quite well and I am getting through a significant amount of work each lesson and I am understanding the majority of what I am doing.</td>
