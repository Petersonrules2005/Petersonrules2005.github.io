    <td>The trickiest thing about this IT lesson was recording my results at the end of the lesson. The trouble was that there were multiple sections under one number. This meant that when I thought I was on Section 4 I was really on the second section of Section 3. Mr Keen said to do whatever was clearer for me so I recorded it as Section 3b. </td>

    <td>My learning was limited by two things, time and my reading speed. The two limiters for the lesson kind of went hand in hand. This lesson, for all my many personal flaws, I feel went really well. The two limiters limit me in every lesson however I feel they limited me more in this lesson than any prior because in this lesson I was on a role. I got through at least a Section and a half in the hour I was in the IT labs and that is the most I have ever done and more than I think I will ever do again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I will have to slow down and actually absorb more of the information I am being told by Learn Python Codeacademy instead of skim reading it to rush and get ahead. Also we have Exam week and then the Half Term Holidays so I am sure I will have forgotten a lot about Python and will need at least a 10 min recap.</td>
