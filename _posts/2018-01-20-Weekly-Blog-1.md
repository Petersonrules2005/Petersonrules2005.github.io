    <td>I was working with my friend Ben and we found it easier to learn when we read what was going on out loud and made sense of it together. The very first instruction we had trouble with because in the instructions it called an icon one thing where on the actual FUZE it was called another thing. We just assumed they were one and the same and they were. About 15 minutes into the lesson Mr Ampah-Korsah told us we were supposed to switch every 10 mins. So far I had been reading out what to do and Ben had been doing it so we decided that every time the last number on the fuze was a zero we would swap over.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by what we were allowed  to do. We had been told to follow the instructions to the letter and not miss anything out so that limited what we could do now but expanded what we could do in the future. I need to work on the urge to steam on ahead really quickly. I need to read slower and I need to make sure I'm making sense. I also need to quell the urge to go and ask Mr Ampah-Korsah.   </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will switch over positions from the start and I we will set up and get started much faster and more efficiently. I will speak more slowly and more clearly in the next lesson. In the next lesson I will improve my learning by thinking about what is actually going on behind what Iâ€™m typing. </td>
