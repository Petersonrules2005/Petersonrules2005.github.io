  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I learned mostly by doing the work given. I also learned by using logic and applying it to whatever situation had me stumped. The strategies I used were mainly copying from the textbook and reading out the writing from the textbook. Occasionally we also used the information the textbook gave us and went off on a tangent adding things to the code that were extra.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited again by my tendency to make things too clever and then break it. That happened less this time than any week prior to this because when I tried to get to smart my partner ignored me and did what he was meant to do. When I was coding I often changed the script to be shorter to speed us up or amusing because I like to keep things interesting. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and get started a lot faster, by finding my page quicker and getting everything set up and working faster. I will improve my learning by continuously catching myself and making sure I am not over complicating things or going off on a tangent.   </td>
