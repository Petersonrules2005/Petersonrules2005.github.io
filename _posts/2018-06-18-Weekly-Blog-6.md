    <td>This lesson I didn't really learn much at all. I knew I wouldnâ€™t going in to the lesson so I set myself an easily achievable target if I were not in the condition I was for this lesson. Unsurprisingly to me I only just achieved it and I had to work through so much pain to do it, more that below.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited the little learning that I had and that limited me from doing much work at all was my horrible, hacking cough. It comes every couple of minutes and lasts for a couple of minutes and distracts both me from my work and everyone around me from their work. I need to work on not coughing as loudly and holding in my coughing fits for as long as possible.</td>
