    <td>DISCLAIMER: Again technically, Section 1.5 of FUZE doesn't exist. It is really called Section 1 Project Roundup but, again,  that was to long and boring a title so I just called it section 1.5. That’s still a rubbish title but at least it’s consistent with my other previous titles. I learnt this week by using the changes I said I would make last week. We discussed where we hoped to be at the end of the lesson, at the start of the lesson, not the beginning. We only swapped places at logical points and that helped the lesson flow work better.</td>

    <td>The main limit to my learning this lesson was the lack of a teacher. Mr Ampah-Korsah was off this lesson so we were watched over by a teacher from another class and they didn’t really know what they were doing. My learning was also limited this lesson by lack of time and communication errors. The lack of time came from the fact that our lesson started late due to the aforementioned lack of a teacher. The communication errors came from the retainer I was wearing. Essentially, I was unintentionally spitting a lot and what I was saying was slurred, and when I was listening, not talking, my partner was distracted and was saying things he didn’t mean by accident. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>By the next lesson many of the problems of this lesson with have solved themselves without any input or effort from me. Mr Ampah-Korsah will be in the next lesson which means we will have the full 1 hour of lesson time and a teacher to help us out when we need it. Also my talking will have improved by the next lesson because I will have had practice speaking will it in which will make me easier to understand. </td>
