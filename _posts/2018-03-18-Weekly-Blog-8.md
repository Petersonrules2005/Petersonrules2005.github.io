    <td>I learned by applying the two things we were told by Mr Keen to guide us; that all we need is Syntax and Logic. He then explained what Syntax was. Syntax is basically the words that make up any language. Logic is just logic. That helped me learned because it gave me all the information I needed to understand the instructions i was being given to complete the tasks I was being asked to do for this terms coursework.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning wasn't really limited this lesson because I approached the work with a completely blank mind in regards to what I was going to do. I had no idea what to expect going into the lesson and therefore I had no knowledge previously as to what to do so I could learn from, and follow the instructions without deviating or trying to be too smart which is what I do in every other subject. I currently do not have any habits to be worked on but I am sure some will develop as I become more confident using Python.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change my approach towards tasks slightly. From doing the homework I discovered that my memory for how to do things in Python is awful so I will have to start each lesson by spending about 5 minutes or so recapping on what I learned last lesson. This will improve my learning because every week I recap something I learn about Python the more likely I am to remember it and therefore the more likely I am to use it well.</td>
