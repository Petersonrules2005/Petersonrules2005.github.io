    <td> In my opinion the most effective strategy I employed  was simplicity. I learnt by, as I said I would in my last blog, reading over the previous titles of the exercises that I had completed to refresh my memory of the knowledge, to whatever amount, I had accrued in the lessons prior. This helped because I then, though I had wasted about 5 minutes looking back I could make the next 55 minutes being as productive as possible.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited as I guessed it would be by my natural instinct to overcomplicate things. Even though, since this is a task where the whole purpose of the coding is to make us think deeply and logically about capitals and spellings etc you may think that being smart arsed and overcomplicating would be a good thing but no, not really. On another point my spelling needs to improve a lot because all the exercises we are doing are super finicky. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time before I press run on any code I have typed out I will check for spelling because I really need to due to the lack of spelling ability I mentioned earlier. I will also improve my learning by reading the description of the thing we are learning in more detail instead of the usual skim reading I have been doing up until now.</td>
