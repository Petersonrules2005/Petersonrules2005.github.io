    <td>This lesson went much the same as my last lesson. However I had learned to cope a lot better with being sick and coughing almost constantly since the last lesson I had with this affliction. I coped with it a bit better and I got quite a bit further this lesson than I did in the previous lesson but my main hindrance was still my illness. The most effective strategy was to hold in the coughing for an exercise then cough for a while then rinse and repeat. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning once again was limited by my excessive coughing, this week accompanied by a blocked nose. I had a bottle of water for this lesson and that is a habit I need to work on because I forget it far more often than I should. I habit I should also work on is bringing tissues to lessons because since we do not have our blazers I keep forgetting to bring tissues.</td>

    <td>Next time I will hopefully not be sick and that will hopefully improve my learning even more for next lesson than it did for this lesson. Also I will cover my mouth before coughing.</td>
