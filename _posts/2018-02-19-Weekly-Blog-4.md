    <td>I learned by using everything I knew and everything I was being told by the manual to write and run an efficient copy of what the manual was telling me to do with my partner, which this week was back to Ben again. From the beginning we changed roles every ten minutes. We knew that we were behind the rest of the class but only slightly so we changed everything a small bit so we were showing we understood the work but we were doing it quickly.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that Ben was a little bit behind me and I had to catch him up. However, this was not a large limitation because he is really good at IT. I need to continue to work on my habit of over complicating things for myself by trying to be too clever. This week however it was better because I was acknowledging it and I had Ben to help me and he is very good at keeping things simple and not being to clever. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will continue to work on my habits and I will be caught up with all my blogs at the beginning of next lesson not the end. Next time I will change the way I approach problems and I will attempt to be less finicky about capitalisation and grammar. I will improve my learning by retaining all the information I have learned throughout previous lessons and use this to work quickly because we are behind. </td>
