    <td>Today's lesson was the first lesson after a half term of not doing Python at all. This meant that I was inevitably going to take longer to get things done and therefore get less done. This wasn’t helped by some technical difficulties (see below). I decided it was worth spending 15 minutes at the beginning of the lesson looking at some old exercises to remind myself of vocabulary and functions.</td>

    <td>This lesson my learning was limited by a host of random technical issues. These issues started with my usual computer and monitor just not working for no apparent reason. This led to me having to move and use another computer across the classroom. This computer, while usable, was barely so and it was the only spare computer in the classroom. The main monitor kept shutting down and rebooting itself for no reason while I was in the middle of exercises. While this on its own may not have affected my work much the other monitor’s hinge was broken which meant it kept swinging back to a stupid angle that I couldn’t work at.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will get a good monitor right from the get go even if it means "borrowing" somebody else’s. This may seem like a bad thing to do but it may be necessary as I feel I am behind the rest of the class. However, I may only feel like I am substantially behind the rest of the class because the majority of the rest of the class instead of putting 3b they put four and that stacks up. </td>
