    <td>Today my partner was off sick so I worked with Liam Moss. Liam and me were at different stages so he helped me get to the stage he was at without telling me exactly what to do. He read what was in the book and then told me what he and his partner had figured out in the last lesson. This helped me learn what I needed to know quickly while not just giving me the answers. This was very effective and fast. If we had continued this way we would have achieved my target but we had a problem saving everything onto our USB sticks. We eventually figured it out but there was very little lesson time left so we didn't start the next exercise.</td>
