    <td>Today my partner was off sick so I worked with Liam Moss. Liam and me were at different stages so he helped me get to the stage he was at without telling me exactly what to do. He read what was in the book and then told me what he and his partner had figured out in the last lesson. This helped me learn what I needed to know quickly while not just giving me the answers. This was very effective and fast. If we had continued this way we would have achieved my target but we had a problem saving everything onto our USB sticks. We eventually figured it out but there was very little lesson time left so we didn't start the next exercise.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I over complicated things for myself by trying to be too clever and include a bunch of things that I don’t need to do such as changing the colours or adding in different words or just trying to be too clever that I overstep my limits and then get stuck and have no idea what to do next. I need to stay within the limits of what I know and what I have been taught so I don’t get stuck and have to get help.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will use what I have learned today to progress quickly and help me and my partner Ben get through the chapter we are working on very quickly so we can progress fast and efficiently. I will improve my learning by getting a lot more involved in the process instead of letting Ben do everything.</td>
