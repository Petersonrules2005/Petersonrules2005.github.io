    <td>Technically Section 1.5 of FUZE is the Section 1 Project Roundup but that was to long a title so I just called it section 1.5. We learned this week differently because we had to use what we learned in the previous weeks because the task we had to complete was set to test our knowledge of the last stages. To complete this task we referred back to the previous sections to check things that we could potentially change to make the end results more unique and interesting.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the factors that I have previously mentioned though I am dealing with them in different ways, (see below) but now I have a new problem that creeped up this lesson. The code has to be extremely precise or it completely breaks. This was specifically annoying this lesson because we were trying to combine what we'd learned and fit it all together while at the same time making it unique and interesting.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will begin the lesson by discussing our aim for the lesson at the start of the lesson and then working towards that for the entire lesson instead of beginning without a goal and deciding on a goal about halfway through. This should help improve my learning by making my work more efficient because we have a specific goal that we can strive towards. I will also improve my learning by not switching positions with Ben until we reach a point where it makes sense to do so.</td>
