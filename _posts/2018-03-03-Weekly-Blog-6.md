    <td>I learnt the same way this week that I have every other week, by doing, and by reading. This was as effective as usual and we actually got through a lot more of the work than I thought we would. We got to the end of Section 1.4 but we didn't finish it. We were working on the final assessments when the lesson ended. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by a new pet peeve I’ve developed. Using the keyboard that is attached to the FUZE box for some reason makes my spelling a lot worse than it normally is and I’m not sure why. At first I thought it was just me rushing and making silly mistakes but it’s not. Well it is but at the same time it’s not. What I mean by that, is that, while I was making silly spelling errors they were not anything that I wouldn’t normally make but there was more… There were errors even someone with spelling as bad as mine wouldn’t make some of the ones I did. I need to work on figuring out why this is happening so I can stop it.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will prepare for my spelling to be awful and I will double check all spelling. The problems mentioned prior are still in play so next time I will have to combat both those problems and this will inevitably end up improving my learning. Also to improve my learning I will try to understand why works works.</td>
